WP Developers Toolkit
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that does all kinds of neat stuff. I can speed up the frontend of a site, the backend of the site, and I offer all kinds of neat enhancements like a Liberty Alliance dashboard theme, restricted access to menu items, etc.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the WordPress Popular Posts Feedmaker options screen under Settings to configure the plugin.
